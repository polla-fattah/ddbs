## DDBS Architectures

### Elements to Study Today

* Homogeneous and heterogeneous DDBS
* Client-server architecture
* Peer-to-peer architecture
* Multi-database systems
* Federated databases

---
## Introduction

* Distributed Database Systems (DDBS) overcome constraints of centralized databases.
* Data is spread across sites, but users see a unified database.

## Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous DDBS

**Homogeneous:**

* Same data model, query language, protocols
* Easier to manage

**Heterogeneous:**

* Diverse models, languages, protocols
* Offers flexibility

*Table comparing the two types?*

---
## Client-Server Architecture

* Clients send requests, servers process and respond
* Scalable, fault-tolerant, secure

*Diagram of clients connected to a central server*

---
## Peer-to-Peer Architecture

* Nodes are both clients and servers
* Decentralized, no single point of failure

*Image of a mesh network with interconnected nodes*

---
## Multi-Database Systems

* Integrate diverse databases into one framework
* Overcome limitations of standalone systems

*Image of several database icons merging into one*

---
## Federated Databases

* Seamless access to distributed data sources
* Unified interface, supports varied data models
